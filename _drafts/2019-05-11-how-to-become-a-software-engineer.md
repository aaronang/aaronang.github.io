Recently, someone asked me how to become a software developer and I thought the
question was very broad. It is a very hard question to answer. There are so many
resources available nowadays and I can imagine it to be difficult for a newcomer
to find the right resource.

Before we get started, I think it is important to ask yourself why software
development? It's okay if you don't know the answer. Maybe you are just curious
or maybe pursuing a career in software might provide you with better
opportunities.
