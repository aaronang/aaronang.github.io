Recently, someone asked me how to become a software developer and I thought the
question was very broad. It is a very hard question to answer. There are so many
resources available nowadays and I can imagine it to be difficult for a newcomer
to find the right resource. In this article, I will discuss possible routes to
becoming a software developer.

## Why software development?

I think it is important to ask yourself why software
development? It's okay if you don't know the answer. Maybe you are just curious
how computers work or how Google Chrome works, 
or maybe pursuing a career in software development might provide you with better
opportunities. 

Do you have certain idea in mind that you would love to work out?
Having a goal will often make learning programming easier. For example, if you 
would like to create a mobile application, then creating a roadmap for mobile
development will make the most sense. Similarly, if you would like to predict
the stock prices, then creating a roadmap for data science might make sense.
